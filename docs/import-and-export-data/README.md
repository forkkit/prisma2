# Importing and exporting data

As Prisma currently doesn't provide a way to import and export data from/into a database, the documents in this folder describe **native import/export flows** for the databases that are supported by Prisma:

- [Importing and exporting data with PostgreSQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database-workflows/import-and-export-data/postresql)
- [Importing and exporting data with MySQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database-workflows/import-and-export-data/mysql)
- [Importing and exporting data with SQLite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database-workflows/import-and-export-data/sqlite)
